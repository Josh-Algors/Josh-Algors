# 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Olukoyа

I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience designing scalable backend systems, architecting distributed applications, and building AI-powered developer tools. I bring a deep focus on performance, reliability, and developer experience.

💡 I thrive in fast-paced environments where solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and delivering value quickly are key. My approach blends strong fundamentals in software engineering with a builder mentality shaped by both startup and enterprise settings.

🧰 My core expertise includes:
- Backend Development with **Java**, **Golang**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**
- Distributed Systems, Event-Driven Architectures, and Job Queues
- AI/ML Integration with **OpenAI**, **HuggingFace**, and custom pipelines
- DevOps tooling with **Docker**, **Kafka**, **Redis**, **CI/CD**, and observability stacks

🌱 I’m always learning and exploring emerging technologies, especially in systems programming, AI tooling, and infrastructure at scale.

🤝 I’m open to collaboration, mentoring, and mission-driven work that pushes boundaries in engineering and innovation.
